Simple Ciphers
===

My kids recently developed an interest in 'spy stuff'.  In order to stoke those STEM skills, we've created a few decoding gadgets and they've learnt about some simple encryption.  Obviously this undertaking requires a steady stream of codes to decipher to keep the fire burning.  This code is meant to make my side of the deal a little easier (esp since there are 4 kids and only 1 me).
